"""
Hey!

Funny seeing you sneaking around in here.
When creating your bot, keep in mind that when your bot is run,
it will not be with this exact file. It will be on the hosts side.
Any modifications you make here will not work when it comes to a tournament.
If you have found a bug, say, dont fix it yourself.
